        <div class="center-words">…and most of them are due to human causes not surprisingly. 
			According to the USDA Forest Service, more than 500 million birds are killed every 
			year due to human activities. Collisions with windows, electrocution by power lines, 
			and the use of pesticides in farming all account for a few of the things that lead 
			up to those deaths. That is not to say there aren’t bigger factors however…

	<div class="center-box">
		<div class="center-words">Oil spills, over-fishing, habitat destruction, and poaching are among
			 the deadliest. With losses to their food supply and homeland, many bird species are dwindling 
			 towards extinction with illegal poaching not making the situation any better.

	<div class="heading"> But There is Hope...</div>
    <div class="center-box">
		<div class="center-words">Due to conservation efforts around the globe in forms such as fundraising 
			for sanctuaries and the passing of laws preventing hunting of endangered birds and/or over-hunting,
			many of these birds have been brought back from near extinction. Despite all the progress we have made
			there is still work to be done. By donating to sanctuaries such as _______, you can help the beauty of
			these endangered birds thrive once again in their natural habitats.
