                A rather small bird, different to its owl cousins it usually hunts during the day for prey that is sometimes twice as 
                big as itself with its abnormally large claws. Once thought to be extinct, over a century would pass until the Forest 
                Owlet was rediscovered in 1997 in Maharashtra, India. Since then many more owlets were found, but mostly in pairs all 
                over the place rather than one congregated area. This fragmentation of where the owlets are living most likely stems 
                from illegal logging and the natural growth of agriculture as time goes on. Today, there is an estimated population of 
                between 70-400 in the world today.

            As told in their name, the White Crested Laughingthrust are known for their unique cry that makes it sound like they are laughing.
            They generally live in mountainous areas in southern Asia, traveling in flocks and mainly eating insects. Currently, they arenâ€™t
            endangered, in-fact they are of least concern, but their population is decreasing due to the regular after effects of the growing
            agricultural industry and increased use of chemicals and pesticides in farming areas.
