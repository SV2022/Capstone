    The Wooping Crane is one of the largest birds in North America, being on average 5 feet tall and weighing around 15 pounds during adulthood.
    With its black-tipped wings, alongside its insanely long neck and beak make this bird a great hunter, feasting on mostly small fish, amphibians, and other creatures 
    that dwell near wetlands and marshes;That doesn't mean only hunt however, they have also been known to eat acorns and grains as well. Once being found all over the 
    continent, now the species is critically endangered, the only natural population found at Wood Buffalo National Park in Alberta, Canada. Due to habitat loss and unrestricted
    hunting in the past, the population of these birds dropped to 15 at some point, however, due to conservation efforts, the species is gradually climbing once again, though
    still at a rather low estimate of 800 in the world.

Similar to the closely-related blue jay, they are relatively small birds that live in relatively open areas(of course mostly in Florida.)
They mostly eat acorns and insects. Currently these birds are classified as vulnerable, but could easily become an endangered species due
to loss of habitat through urbanization and agricultural advancements. Also, as it described in its name, this bird can usually only be
found in Florida, making it relatively sought after by bird collectors.
