    A famous bird most recognized for its prominence in the Rio movie duology. With an obvious blue coloring to its feathers and a short and
    stubby beak, it usually eats nuts and seeds. This bird has actually gone extinct-in the wild at least. In captivity, there are an estimated
    100-200 birds in the world. The reason for their loss of population? Habitat destruction, deforestation, and illegal bird collectors.
    With further efforts to preserve the species, there is a chance to reintroduce the macaw back into the wild, but without it even needing to be
    said, the species is incredibly close to being confirmed for extinction in the near future.

A relatively small bird recognized for its enormous yellow-orange beak. Weighing only 20 ounces, they are known to be omnivores, 
using their beaks to stab open hard shells of various fruits and snack on small rodents and lizards. Despite being popular options 
as pets for the public for their beaks, they are still listed as endangered due to the rate at which their habitat is being destroyed. 
If that rate isnâ€™t stopped or at the least slowed, the toucan along with many other species could be facing extinction in the wild.
